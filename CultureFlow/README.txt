Early Implementation GUI
-This is the first GUI I built for the automated cell culture system (shown in SolidWorks_Render.jpg). It's all in one where the graphical and control portions of the system are intertwined.

Latest GUI (MVC Architecture)
-This is the recent version of the GUI where I employed a Model-View-Control architecture. The controller acts as a go-between for the model and view by taking the role of the experimenter running various protocols and adding settings. The view tells the controller what to do on a high-level and the model defines what the controller has to work with. Using classes for various widgets and passing variables in a standardized way makes the code manageable and hence sustainable.

Electronics
-These are the system's power electronics which include a current limited power connection to protect a vulnerable component from being over powered.

-This is the system as I have designed in SolidWorks and am currently in the process of assembling.
