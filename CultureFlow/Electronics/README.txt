Included are screenshots of the schematic and final design of the power board for the fluid handler system depicted in the parent folder. The system needs 24, 12, and 5V power outputs. In one case the 24V outlet needed to be current limited. Here I applied an op-amp in a differential amplifier configuration which measures a voltage drop across a sensing resistor and produces an error signal when that voltage is higher than that corresponding to 1.25A loaded on the system. A thyristor is then triggered which draws current away from the main circuit shutting the device down. The device can be powered again once the power is removed and turned back on.
