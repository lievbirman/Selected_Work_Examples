Active_Learning_Boltzmann_Factors.html

Boltzmann factors are functions that give you the state probability for physical systems interacting with very large thermal reservoirs (and example is the air in a room with windows) and are used all over physics to predict things like the rate of promoter binding onto DNA. Here I tried to develop an activelearning styled introduction to Boltzmann factors. My goal was to teach the statistics as it emerges from concept of entropy and to insert illuminating and poignant problems along the way such that the student gains a deep understanding of the concept from just one pass of the material.






Glomerulus_Physics_Pres.pptx

The Glomerulus is the filtration unit of the kidney. 
At Agarwal Lab, we wanted to fully consider what physical parameters we need to control in order to recreate the proper physiological conditions within our chip platform, without over-complicating the experiment. I studied and summarized kidney filtration, which mainly consists of an osmotic pressure based filtration through a porous membrane, with a charge component selecting for albumin. I then simulated our kidney chip to determine what pressures we'd need to apply at each end in order get the desired pressure at the position of the filter.
